1.30  2021-01-13

- change bugtracker to GitHub issues

- guard against trailing slashes for paths in @INC

- interprete more common "use lib" idioms

1.29  2020-08-16

- implement interpretation of stuff like

  use FindBin;
  use lib "$FindBin/../lib";

1.28  2020-08-06

- placate cperl ("Attempt to change hash while iterating over it.")

- make _find_encoding() more robust

1.27  2019-01-15

- fixes by Shawn Laffan <shawnlaffan@gmail.com>
  - Process lines like "{ package foo; use if 1, "warnings"; } (#8)
  - Also handle 'do {use module; ...}'

- some clean ups
  - scandeps.pl: sort output by module name
  - add_deps(): use _gettype() instead of inline code
  - _compile_or_execute(): require DynaLoader _before_ accessing
    its variables
  - t/7-check-dynaloader.t: improve diagnostics

- drop Cwd from the list of potential XS modules

- suppress warnings in some ancient Perls

1.26  2018-12-12

- Glue DLLs of XS modules should have type "shared" rather than "data"

  Detection broke on Windows where nowadays $Config{dlext} = "xs.dll"
  (i.e. it's not a simple suffix)

- Mention some other modules: Module::ExtractUse and Perl::PrereqScanner::* family

- Add %Preload rules for:
  - JSON::MaybeXS
  - HTTP::Entity::Parser
  - FFI::Platypus

1.25  2018-08-18

- Merge pull request #2 from shawnlaffan/master, thanx Shawn!

  continue scanning one-liners when use if, autouse or >5.010 found

- Fix how data obtained from compiling or executing a file
  is incorporated (_info2rv).

  Sanitize all pathnames to use slash (instead of backslash):
  - members of @INC
  - keys and values of %INC
  - members of @dl_shared_objects
  This should make stripping @INC prefixes finally work.

- Add %Preload rule for FFI::Platypus

- Add bugtracker to META.yml

1.24  2017-06-28

- Merge pull request from Salvador FandiÃ±o (salva), thx!
  Specio::PartialDump uses unicore

  charnames.pm
  Unicode/Normalize.pm
  Unicode/UCD.pm

- remove all references to http://par.perl.org/, doesn't exist anymore

1.20  2015-10-04

- Fix RT #107304: Newer versions of File::Path cause warning "_Inline for _Inline: No such file or directory at Module/ScanDeps.pm line 1339."
  - drop the dubious call to rmtree()

- Fix RT106142: Preload dependencies for PDL and PDL::NiceSlice
  - adopted from a patch by Shawn Laffan, thanks Shawn!

- Fix RT#106144: Preload dependencies for File::BOM)
  - adopted from a patch by Shawn Laffan, thanks Shawn!

- Revise our stance on utf8.pm:

  - A line of "use utf8;" just means "this file is encoded in UTF-8"
    and should _not_ result in scanning utf8.pm which will pull in
    the whole Unicode shebang (propery tables and what not).
    Yes, utf8.pm *does* contain "require utf8_heavy.pl", but only inside
    an AUTOLOAD() that is *not* triggered by calling functions
    like utf8::is_utf8().

  - OTOH the innocently looking one-liner

      perl -ne 'print if /\pN/'

    implicitly loads utf8.pm and triggers the AUTOLAD().

  - So prevent utf8.pm from being scanned and make utf8_heavy.pl
    the indicator for "I need the Unicode stuff" instead.

  - Cache the results of _get_preload('utf8_heavy.pl').

- Make %Preload "transitive" so that given

    my %Preload = (
      'Foo.pm' => [ 'Bar.pm' ],
      'Bar.pm' => [ 'Quux.pm' ],
      ...
    );

  scan_deps_static() registers a dependency on Bar.pm _and_
  Quux.pm when it has seen "use Foo;"

- Minor changes:
  - drop dubious %Preload of utf8.pm for SOAP::Lite and XML::Parser::Expat
  - drop code for Perl < 5.008 as we require 5.8.1 already
  - rework the implementation of -x/-c
  - add add_preload_rule() to dynamically add a %Preload rule
  - recognize constructs like "open FH, '<:via(Foo)', ..."
  - upgrade to Module::Install 1.16

1.19  2015-05-27

  - add %Preload entry for MIME::Types: data file MIME/types.db

  - add %Preload rule for AnyEvent

  - always add Encode.pm when fix encountering constructs like

      decode("klingon", ...)
      open FH, "<:encoding(klingon)", ..

  - add license

  - update OpenFoundry repository URL

1.18  2015-01-19

  - Fix RT #101569: Incorrect module parsing if Moose is included

1.17  2014-10-31

  - scandeps.pl: die if an option is not recognized

  - Reformat Changes file according to CPAN::Changes::Spec

  - Modify %Preload rule: let Unicode::UCD explicitly imply utf8.pm.
    This fixes PAR::Packer's self test.
    Previously Unicode::UCD implied utf8.pm implicitly because
    it contains calls to some utf8::foo() functions.

  - Add %Preload rule: Mozilla::CA requires its cacert.pem file

  - Recognize "do filename" constructs even if "do" isn't at the start
    of a chunk.

  - Upgrade to Module::Install 1.14

1.16  2014-09-28

  - Fix RT#98938: recognize Module::Runtime module-loading functions

  - Fix a nasty typo that broke scandeps.pl option -E

      $ scandeps -E "some string"
      Unknown option: E
      Can't open some string: No such file or directory at scandeps.pl line 49.

    - also scandeps.pl: die if an option is not recognized

  - Remove some overzealous heuristics from scan_chunk()
    - they were looking for

      Foo::Bar->something
      Foo::Bar::whatever(...)

    _anywhere_ in programs to infer a dependency on Foo/Bar.pm.

    BEWARE: This might break some use cases, i.e. missing some dependencies.
    On the other hand,  this causes hard to investigate problems like the one
    starting at http://www.mail-archive.com/par@perl.org/msg05531.html.
    While the former can easily be worked around by the user itself (just
    add a missing dependecy explicitly, e.g. using "pp -M ...") and
    typically can be solved in general by adding a %Preload rule,
    the latter just wastes people's times.

  - Recognize Test::More require_ok() and use_ok()
    - makes 3-static_oo_interface_real.t pass again (fallout from the above)

  - Upgrade to Module::Install 1.12

  - Add option -T to request information from CPAN
    - don't access CPAN behind the user's back just because they have
      CPANPLUS installed (it was in the Perl core from 5.10 to 5.18) -
      it might not even have been configured (e.g. in a corporate internet)
    - only do this when explicitly requested

1.15  2014-08-23

  - Fix RT #98203: Migrate from deprecated Module::Build::ModuleInfo to Module::Metadata
    - thanx Petr Pisar (ppisar@redhat.com) for the hint

    also RT #97519 (Fix for t/7-check-dynaloader.t on systems with DynaLoader::mod2fname)
    - applied patch from Brian Fraser (fraserbn@gmail.com), thanks!
    - lib/Module/ScanDeps/DataFeed.pm: apply here, too

1.13  2013-12-21

  - Fix recognition of (open() arguments) "<:encoding(klingon)",
    implies modules PerlIO and PerlIO::encoding.

  - new %Preload rule for B::Hooks::EndOfScope

  - new %Preload rule for Pod::Usage

  - add a fake %Preload rule that warns if use of Module::Implementation
    or Module::Runtime is detected (coz' they're doing runtime loading)

  - change some tests to use Test::Requires instead of homegrown stuff;
    hence add it to "test_requires"
  - clean up some uses of Test::More

1.11  2013-09-28

  - Fix RT #89000: test broken by indirect base.pm disuse
    - delete base.pm from list of expected deps,
      patch by Andrew Main (zefram@fysh.org)

  - new %Preload rule for Net::HTTPS (e.g. used by LWP::Protocol::https)
    - look for IO::Socket::SSL or Net::SSL

  - new %Preload rule for YAML::Any
    - try to figure out what YAML::Any would have used
      (using YAML::Any->implementation)
    - as fallback, include anything below YAML

1.10  2012-10-20

  - add %Preload rule for Params::Validate to detect
    its PP and XS implementations

  - Fix RT #80276 Module DateTime::Format::ISO8601 generates error
    after being packaged
    - caused by failing to pack DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::XXX modules
      needed by DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser
    - add a corresponding %Preload rule

  - update to Module::Install 1.06

1.09  2012-09-09

  - teach Module::ScanDeps about "use if ..." constructs
    - fixes CPAN Testers failures for PAR::Packer with perl 5.17.1 and up
      (Roderich Schupp)

  - RT #79003: t/7-check-dynaloader.t failing when /usr/lib != /usr/lib64
    - scrap the test for "$entry{file} starts with $expected_prefix" as
      its assumptions are flawed (Roderich Schupp)

  - Mojo::Base is a loader (Alexandr Ciornii)
  - Special case for Class::Load (Alexandr Ciornii)

1.08  2012-02-21

  - RT #73785: scandeps -c fails on modules that depend on Getopt::Euclid
    - for "scandeps -c ..." switch from an INIT block to a CHECK block
      and call the augmented script with "perl -c"  instaed of "perl"

  - RT#72954 ":encoding(UTF-8)" doesn't imply a dependency on Encode.pm
    - if scan_chunk sees ":encoding(FOO)" or similar, it goes to some
      length to find the "external" Encode module to handle FOO; but it
      forgets that Encode.pm itself is needed at runtime (esp. if FOO
      is an encoding "internally" handled by Encode.pm, e.g. "UTF-8")

  - %Preload: add rules for Gtk2.pm and Pango.pm
  - %Preload: fix a problem with Image::ExifTool

1.07  2011-11-29

  - RT #72796: dynaloader test fails when the .so files are in the
    system lib dirs and local::lib is involved?
    Relax a check in t/7-check-dynaloader.t
  - Update Module::Install to 1.04

1.06  2011-11-28

  - RT #72211: pp includes way too much modules (when using 'use strict;')?
    Rework regexes to detect "use MODULE ...":
    the following line from unicore/mktables

      my $unihan = 'Unihan properties are by default not enabled in the Perl core.  Instead use CPAN: Unicode::Unihan';

    would erroneously detect a dependency on CPAN.pm (which will in turn
    pull in a lot of modules)
  - Bump Perl version requirement to 5.8.1 (Schwern: The End Of 5.6 Is Nigh!)
  - Rewrite t/7-check-dynaloader.t to look for more candidates of dynamic modules
    that might be used as test cases

1.05  2011-11-02

  - RT #72082: $FindBin::Bin issue on Moudel::ScanDeps 1.04
    Make FindBin work (at least with option -c or -x) by spoofing $0
    in the temp script generated for M:SD::DataFeed

  - Brown paper bag bug: fix option -x (execute) (broken by changes for -c)
  - While we're at it: honor option -I with -c

1.03  2011-07-18

  - RT #69213: ScanDeps incompatible with AnyEvent (Perl 5.14, AnyEvent 5.34, PAR 1.00.2)
    For option -c (compile) M:SD used to wrap the file in one big sub and
    appended an END block where it dumps %INC etc; the outer sub causes problems
    with certain contructs. Instead we now use an INIT block prepended
    to the file.

  - RT #69471: Problem with "eval { require SomeModule }" constructions
    Module::ScanDeps::DataFeed now omits %INC pairs with an undefined value
    (these may be created by an unsuccessful "require" under certain conditions).
    Also omit CODE refs from @INC.

  - Fix for failing CPAN Testers report
    http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/4208fa16-a5d1-11e0-a0bc-c71a7862a918:
    Perl 5.15.0 got rid of Shell.pm

  - Fix for failing CPAN Testers report
    http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/772147dc-6c1f-1014-baf2-318eb63ba09a:
    - regex meta characters in filenames break consistency check

  - Simplify Module::ScanDeps::DataFeed somewhat by localizing %INC
    around "require Module::ScanDeps::DataFeed" and by using Data::Dumper
    for the actual dump.

  - Don't create the tempfiles for DataFeed in the working directory.

  - Purge all pod from Module::ScanDeps::DataFeed, advise the  CPAN
    indexer not to bother with it; same for Module::ScanDeps::Cache.

1.02  2011-04-03

  - %Preload: add _all_ *.pl file below .../unicore for utf8.pm

1.01  2011-03-26

  - speed up scanning *significantly* by not re-constructing regexen
    for every line of input and reducing the no. of sub calls (Steffen Mueller)
  - add Eric Roode to AUTHORS (Steffen Mueller)
  - RT #61027: "use lib" does not work (Roderich Schupp)
    scan_line(): When handling "use lib '/some/dir'" we add "/some/dir/ARCHNAME",
    "/some/dir/VER" and "/some/dir/VER/ARCHNAME", but forgot
    to add "/some/dir" itself.
    While we're at it, improve parsing the argument list of "use lib".
    Simply eval the string, this should at least make all forms of
    quoted strings work correctly.

    (Roderich Schupp)
  - Added some File::Spec'ness. (Steffen Mueller)
